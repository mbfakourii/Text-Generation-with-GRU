If this real niXga business then you niXgas unemployed
Jumped on the celly called Machiavelli
He says he was gravy I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror said Yous an ill niXga
Then I ran to the money like track and field niXga

In a world full of asskissers and dick pullers

Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks I just enjoy the head

Smoking on a hallelujah thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R Im a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass and everybodys looking
But how can you get the picture if you dont know who took it
This current affairs but who the hell cares
Everybodys fighting over positions musical chairs
On the road to redemption go on and use a few stairs
Im just fucking ready so I come prepared yeah
I know your name yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion damn
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise we dont know that its there
And I see you with your palms in your pants
But me me see me I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger Im a critical thinker

Because I got my thang my thang my thang

Hard hat no but I got tha tool on
And you should be my paper if ever tha tool drawn

VerseLittle Brother
How many ways can I say Im done fishin

Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food foreign cars many women
And some say its the life I was given
I say it dont matter if I work at McEDs
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees
On a new broad you still one to one
Every once in again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but whats done is done
Women steppin out for love men do what to come
Not a playa like Pun but when shorties get the grabbin on me
The last thought I get is Koobie run
To them girls wishin on a star thats will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is hun one
Chorus x Lil Brother First Lil Wayne Second
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know

VerseLil Brother
We was high school sweethearts talkin since we was teens
Every morning and every evening
Ten years later she eatin that mean cuisine

Word get back to wifey she like Stop the song
Im takin the kids to my mommas Im out Im gone
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears
But Ive been with your daddy for boutyears
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating
But I aint never had to wear no black eye from beatings
As long as he doing right by you and your kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is
I aint sayin that its right but we often pay the price
Cause a womens life is love a mans love is life
And he gon live it to the fullest and I aint tryna pull you down or sound
like a broken record
But you should know by now that all niXgas is dogs
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard
Chorus x
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart
VerseLil Wayne
I say I dont have nothin if I dont have you
Like Shadai we got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep like your first tattoo
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I dont want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey girl dont play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
You gotta hold ya soldier down
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner
And you dont want to leave me believe me
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv
Its young weezy I know what ya thought
But Im just here to play my part so dont go breakin my heart
Chorus x Lil Wayne First Lil Brother Second
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know

I told myself to save yourself cause I cant save you

Tell them niXgas no love lost cause I aint got shit to lose

But I graduated from that bullshit now I hate school
Outro

My french girls love it when we smoke the oo oui
En belle au france I do when we smoke the ooey

My bodies unique like the sistine chapel
Fresh freshspring apples

And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

Gas in my blunt watching ESPN
And if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah Im from College Park and I got ya broad with me
Salt water pool I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic plus I named my pistols
Last name Fuck first name I Dont Give A
Pockets look pregnant they bout to deliver
So when I start dippin you know the procedure
You leave your home for days and days
All my niXgas gangstas all my bitches freaks
I tickle her pussy got that pussy tickle pink
Im the heart of the streets and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet I want that candy trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth so all my words are precious
Im so fuckin hot I sssssss Ima need some more Ss
Man Im on some other shit I want another bitch
That want another bitch and I dont cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock man I rather punch a brick
Cause Im that niXga and Im so cold I just shivered
These niXgas think they hard these niXgas just nipples
I pop a niXga like a sicle drop a niXga like a missile
Mo money mo issues I size you up then fit you
Tunechi
You leave your home for days and days

Hearing through the grapevine niXgas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift man you better be Peyton
Boy the heats on they make a peace bond
Im in this bitch throwing up the seventeenth sign
Straight frowns no daps strapped three times
That Teceleven AK forty seven one Beretta ready for whatever
Tell them pussy niXgas come together
Happy better niXga niXga super soaker wetter niXga
Six feet under flowers you aint nothing but a petal niXga
Im just a little niXga trying to be a civil niXga
Thirty years old shit thatll be a giving niXga
Quit it Wayne your Mom is listening
But she aint really trippin cause the pots is pissed in
Them niXgas tripping until the shots whistling
Hear them bullets sizzle like a cobra at attention
I gotta bitch and quit calling women bitches
As long as she dont worry bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind I gotta get it
Im admitted to the game true playa no quitting
There you go shitting on a way a niXga thanking
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
This is the future aint promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Train in the tidal wave this is the ocean
Stand in the heat til the mother fucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope let them tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless rats and roaches
Running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune
Come and get it automatics in motion
We banging for the bread niXga even the molded
I got my loaf I got my toast
Chaperon of the south I got my coast yea
And until I die Im the the the the the best rapper alive
Im mac maine and this young money you betta em
Straight out the hood a young hoodlum
Done what i shouldnt did but they said i couldnt
Hid where all the killas hid at

Two seater sweve traffic ta hell with it shit you cant die with cant
Shit you cant die with it cant go ta jail with it
Might as well lay in it pass and then fail with it

Give them niXgas something ta them bitches smelling like money after full
court scrimmage
The fam at the table got a full course dinner
Young money cash money throw pifatti at the winner
And yet he understund us when we told him break it off
Cause gangstas talk one word will be a wall
Alone with two cant handle this destructin
All body killin baby sound like seductin

Sometimes you goota out the whole rooster in the oven
So tell the public ima do my thing

I just wanna float float like Muhammad
I dont ever wanna see the bottom the bottom

Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg Im on some some adope grown up type shit
Look who I be around niXga look who I been around niXga
Geezy Juve and Turk be and Slim dawg pay attention dawg
Verse
Age is nothin but some digits niXga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every ripcas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night shell flip
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when Im pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin Im Tyson and shit
But Im a man so Im here to handle my situtions correctly
And i noI might be dumb but niXgas gone definantly respect me
But in the mean partner Im fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like im livin happy now
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke aboutblunts
and puff a cooler bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
just so I get through the stuff but I be like
Chorus x
Ahhhh man its complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man
Im gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN
Verse
I try to keep my head up but I die to keep my bread up
And usually Im fed up thinkin everythangs a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And i get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff trust me its tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
And Im walkin on the edge stuck without a solution
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
And I dont need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it
Cas yall cats dont really no me yall jus no bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest
And I aint neva said they dont appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasnt a man I wouldnt make it through
Chorus x
Verse
Who would have known that this was somthin that didnt turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
Im influenced and effected by the way it became
And I dont play with them at all so I dont say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
Im always street so Ill forever be facin a change
And Ill keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then Im waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And Im so often Im congratulated for the succeced at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didnt ask for you to like me I dont care if you hate me
But dont mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell Im gone
And I dawg I do believe Im grown
so Ill be good on my own but I be like
Chorus fadingBelieve Dat

Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn
I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier
Young man young money with the money long
Currency tha hot spitta it so grown
And ur perception of me is so wrong
Dont worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved
And you dont rock like them I can see it in your eyes
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise
cause tonight you lookin like ms right
And I swore to be a player for life but Ill change for you

And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato

Hey
I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
Were apart and away
And it feels so stray
Nge wouldnt you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could
Do it again x
Hey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
Do it again
Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But imma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then Ill be there to catch you
Yes
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didnt do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
Do it again x
Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And Im just wishin
We could
Do it again x

Eastside
Up in tha beat
Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niXgas like momma taught me
One man with no weopon at war but Im an army
My flow is capital attention lieutenant your penit pension
And they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up

Or else you better donald duck
Like a shooting range target

NiXga I got good luck
NiXga bye bye good luck
Got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass niXga who thought popeye wasnt tough
Im on that lala twist it up
Im on that syrup slow it down
And I like four freeks too and I aint young jock but its going down
I buy that marijuana field then I just smoke it down
Big bad wolf yes I just blow it down
No homo and to holly grove I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives I got the sharpest flow around
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Bitch Im Mack Maine
I got tha heart of a king blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before my second time to the grave
But its one life to live thats why Im gettin paid
Off a flow thats priceless I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise
Blaze as I gaze at the stars and ask the lord
Why the culprit at the pall pit
It make me sick to my stomach
Thats why I rap like a pregnant woman I dont spit I vomit
So pay homage me and wayne two Gs
Like twenty hundreds
And we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothas from anotha
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something
Thats a hint to you David
Throwin shots at Goliath
'This the new testament where the victor is tha giant
So you should get your way and lose the hate
Remember males shouldnt be jealous thats a females trait
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world


﻿baby It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt n Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack Mr Magic Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu sippin on Private Stock
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke duhha duhha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now Im in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G Brucey B Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex Lovebug Starski wassup
Im blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib same number same hood thats right
Its all good its aaalll good
And if you dont know now you know niXga You know very well who you are
Dont let em hold you down reach for the stars
You had a few but not that many
Cause youre the only one Ill give you good and plenty I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And Im far from cheap I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love its the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen this rappin stuff
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin karats in my baby girls ears
Lunches brunches interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And its still all good
Uh and if you dont know now you know niXga You know very well who you are
Dont let em hold you down reach for the stars
You had a few but not that many
Cause youre the only one Ill give you good and plenty Super Nintendo Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke man I couldnt picture this
Fifty inch screen money green leather sofa
Got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two Gs flat
No need to worry my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day no more public housing
Thinking back on my oneroom shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course

Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Check it I grew up a fuckin screwup
Got introduced to the game got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The niXga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that niXga Im too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
Thats why I bust back it dont phase me
When he drop take his Glock and Im Swayze
Celebrate my escape sold the Glock bought some weight
Lay back I got some money to make motherfucker And I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Its on me
But still Im having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole worlds trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do
But stay true sipping s of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions trying to stress me
Misery is all I see thats my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes slipped got arrested and flipped
He screamed thug life and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police And I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Good evenin ladies and gentlemen
Hows everybody doin tonight

The Notorious BIG ladies and gentlemen give it up for him yall Uh a niXga never been as broke as me I like that

I aint have ta be in school by ten I was in
Began to encounter wit my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart break it down into section
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes others use injections
Syringe sold seperately Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith Wesson like my dick was missin
To protect my position my corner my layer
While we out here say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she dont need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when your hearts in it
And live the phrase Skys The Limit

Bathroom passes cutting classes squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen a chubby niXga on the scene
I used to have the tre duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin black smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we want to know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat
If not I hope I dont get shot
Betta throw my vest on my chest
Cause niXgas is a mess
It dont take nothin but frontin
For me to start somethin
Buggin and barkin at niXgas like I was duck huntin
Dumbing out just me and my crew
Cause all we want to do is Chorus
Party and bullshit and Repeat x Hugs from the honeys pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man see that I knew from the projects

Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk off the henny and stuff
Or some brandNubian shit beatin down punks Chorus Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress I think I might just
Hit her with a little biggie how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversations blunts in rotation
My man big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
Were smoking drinking got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this niXga biggie stinking
Is it my charm I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said lets leave calm

Rolled up another blunt bought a Heineken
NiXgas start to loke out a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out Cant we just all get along

BIG bring that booty to me Chorus until fade
Its the ten crack commandments what
NiXga cant tell me nothing about this coke
Cant tell me nothing about this crack this weed my hustlin niXgas
NiXgas on the corner I aint forget you niXgas my triple beam niXgas Ive been in this game for years it made me an animal
Its rules to this shit I wrote me a manual
A stepbystep booklet for you to get
Your game on track not your wig pushed back
Rule Number Uno never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy specially
If that man fucked up get yo ass stuck up
Number never let em know your next move
Dont you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips
Number never trust nobody
Your momsll set that ass up properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up shit for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number I know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number never sell no crack where you rest at
I dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
Number that goddamn credit Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back shit forget it
this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood dont mix like dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number shoulda been Number to me
If you aint gettin bagged stay the fuck from police
If niXgas think you snitchin they aint trying to listen
They be sittin in your kitchen waiting to start hittin
Number a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men not for freshmen
If you aint got the clientele say hell no
Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules youll have mad bread to break up
If not years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up heard in three weeks
She sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go more pies to bake up word up Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet Do you ever ask yourself when are they ever gonna stop
Do you ever ask yourself when are they gonna stop making those hits
Do you ever ask yourself when are they gonna stop making us dance
Do you ever ask yourself
When those bad boy are gonna stop making all this money I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin to reach the next level Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto in a Porsche Carrero But for now Ill play the back of the cruiser
Light another sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer bust out the ruger
Ladies and gentleman Bullets will leave you tremblin

Get there and bury the bricks in the sand They think I want a tan Im sittin on a hundred grand

Smokin blunts with my crew flippin over s
Cause GED wasnt BIG
I got PAID thats why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they dont know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasnt tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause Im due in court
for an assault that I caught in Bridgeport New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand cause man I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle
I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle I had the master plan
Im in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man TwoTecs to take over this projects
They call him TwoTecs he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask Whos next
I got my honey on the Amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant bitch got gassed
At last Im literally loungin black
Sittin back countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to reup see whats up with my peeps
Toyota DealaThon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call it couldnt hit me harder
We got infiltrated like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
by some bitch named Alberta over nickelplated burners
And my bitch swear to God she wont snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks Ill make the hooker rich
Conspiracy shell be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G thats me blowing like a bubble
in the everyday struggle I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle
I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle Im seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
aint tryin to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so shes older now
Educated street knowledge Ima mold er now
Trick a little dough buyin young girls fringes
Dealin with the dope fiend binges seein syringes
in the veins hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin days on the set no sweat
Drunk off Moet cant bag yet because its still wet
But when that dry baggin five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin line
I had the first and the third rehearse thats my word
Thick in the game Ds knew my first name
Should I quit Shit no Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight I gotta teck with air holes
and thats just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker Hah cmon what you say I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle

NiXgas bleed just like us
Id rather go toe to toe with all of yall
Runnin aint in my protocol Since its on I call my niXga Arizona Ron
From Tucson push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on
Mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin chose not to move wisely
Sharper with game him and his crooks caught a jooks
Heard it was sweet bout a piece
Ron bought a truck bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked got locked the fuck up
Thats the raw vantage came back speakin spanish
Lavish habits two rings carats
Heres a criminal
NiXga made Americas Most
Killed his babys mothers brother slit his throat
The niXga got bagged with the toast weeded
Took it to trial beat it
Now he feel he undefeated
He mean it
Nothing To Lose tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything the game embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
Specially if my daughter cryin I aint lyin
Yall know the signs NiXgas bleed just like us
Picture me bein scared of a niXga that breathe the same air as me
NiXgas bleed just like us

Because niXgas could be hidin in showers with Mac Billys
So I freaked em

Gloria from Astoria I went to war with her
Peeps in stole a gun from her workers
And they took drugs they tried to jerk us
We blaze they place long story
Glo seen my face got shook

Now she breakin shut up whats shakin
A Jamaican some bitches I swear

In a black Range Rover
Been outside all day
If its trouble let me know Ill be on my way
Please I got kids to feed I done seen you make niXgas bleed
Nightmare this bitch dont leave
Ron get the gasoline
This spot we bout to blow
Lets get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats know
Its room
Right by the staircase perfect place
When they evacuate they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline
The niXga pass me kerosene
Fuck it its flammable
My hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two
Opposite sexes
One black one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin
I saw her brains hit the floor
Ron laughin
I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least times in the chest
Spint around shot the chick in the breast
She cryin headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases nothin but Franco faces
The spots hot sprinklers alarm systems
Thats when other guests start to slip in
Its time for us to get to dippin
I know them niXgas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin pistol grippin
I know they clippin
The hallway got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us
I dont know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it
Through all the excitement
They Range got towed they double parked by a hydrant

NiXga pass that before you get your grave dug
from the main thug slug
And my niXga Biggie got an itchy one grip
One in the chamber in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip yeah niXga peel

from the Beretta putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers dont have better
Rolex watches and colourful Swatches
Im digging in pockets motherfuckers cant stop it

So lace up your boots cause Im about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back talkin bout the gats in your raps
But I cant feel that hardcore appeal

MCs got to feel one caps I got to peel some
To let niXgaz know that if you fuck with BigandHeavy

NiXgaz sayin Biggie off the street its a miracle
Left the drugs alone took the thugs along with me

On how to burn the block apart break it down into section
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes others use injections
Syringe sold seperately Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith Wesson like my dick was missin
To protect my position my corner my layer
While we out here say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she dont need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when your hearts in it
And live the phrase Skys The Limit

Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever NiXgaz in my faction dont like askin questions

He didnt care spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale rained on competition like a shower

In eightyeight when Kane ruled with Half Steppin
A thirtyeight a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was king til the Ds crept in
And now Im missin em Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns
Ooh Im missin you
Nah nah nah nah nah oh tell me why why why why We work all week weekends we play the movies

Eventually you know they try to do me fuck it
Fed up my niXga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops comin sick of throwin jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper told em go that route
Few months he got his brains blown out
Now Im stressed
His babys mother she trippin blamin me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy you win some you lose some
Damn they lost a brother they mother lost a son
Fuck why my niXga couldnt stay in NY

Damn Im missin her Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns
Ooh Im missin you
Nah nah nah nah nah oh tell me why why why why There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name Drew played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
Shed watch my bomb help my moms with the groceries
My little sister the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girls supposed to be
Far from a lover my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin with some major players
Handled keys niXgas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid had a baby fore that bitch Taya
Found out her babys father cheatin now Drew she gotta slay her
One night across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome fourfour
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived what my baby had to die for
Im missin her Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns
Ooh Im missin you
Nah nah nah nah nah oh tell me why why why why Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns

Representing BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking
It aint nothing they know Big be handling
With the mac in the Ac door paneling
Damagin MCs oxygen they cant breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q by my side lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast you but I have to you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame and them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot Biggie
You know how the weed go unbelievable BIG GIE AKA BIG
Get it Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers cant sleep need sleeping Big keep creeping
Bullets heatseeking casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A dont fuck with BI thats that
Oh I thought he was wack Oh come come now
Why yall so dumb now hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fiftyseven ways
To simmer saute Im the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggies hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented car weed scented
If I said it I meant it
Bite my tongue for noone
Call me evil or unbelievable Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses what you think this is
Aint no amateurs here I damage and tear
MCs fear me they too near not to hear me
Clearly Im the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla when you aint no killer
The gats by your liver your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
NiXgas know the steelo unbelievable Im sticking icepicks on the tip of your dick

playing Larry Johnson and his grand mama fuck around and feel the fury of a high niXga
when I get busy throw you hands in the sky niXga
I got the illest of the ill mentality niXgas be grabbing me
knowing that they rather be stabbing me all up in my back

street rules watch your pockets and your jewels
a niXga front throw a gat to the fool

stuck to your ass like tissue when youre wiping fast
mcs have a hard time believing
Im marked with death hard to kill like steven
with jacob Im leaving
The black mans motto you got a better chance playing lotto Remember back in the days when niXgaz had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Pitchin pennies honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers to nineteen ninety three
NiXgaz is gettin smoked g believe me
Talk slick you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niXgaz aint havin that shit
Totin techs for rep smokin blunts in the project
Hallways shootin dice all day
Wait for niXgaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this aint back in the days but you dont hear me though No more cocoa leaveio one two three
One two three all of this to me is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And Im down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kungfu
Instead of a mac he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and thats what the fucks happenin
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat want ta leave a niXga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion aint a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they cant maintain
Damn shit done changed If I wasnt in the rap game
Id probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either youre slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit its hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shits gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me they got the sky grand pagers
Goin outta town blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn what happened to the summertime cookouts
Everytime I turn around a niXga gettin took out
Shit my momma got cancer in her breast
Dont ask me why Im motherfuckin stressed things done changed Uhh I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh what a set up
Shoulda pushed em dead off wipe the sweat off
Cause in this world Im dead off squeeze lead off
Benz sped off aint no shook hands in Brookland
Army fatigue break up teams the enemies
Look man you want to see me locked up shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket screamin Bastard
Cryin know my friends is lyin
Yall know who killed em filled em with the Lugers from they Rugers
Or they Desert dyin aint the shit but its pleasant
Kinda quiet watch my niXgaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie lazy eye
I was high when they hit me took a few cats with me

I seen her on the block who she rapping to
Thats my niXga Dee damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me see
You know that aint right You know that aint right with a friend of mine Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause Im a rap star
I be cruising up the block I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up pissy scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldnt be classified in that position listen
Shes saying I dissed her cause Im fucking her sister
A message to the fellas that really gets them pissed uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee so why she mad at me True
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
Im glad I aint spend no cash to hit your nasty ass Im sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
Oops Im interrupted by a doorbell who the hell

I gets up quick
Cock my shit Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin
Its a face that I seen before
My niXga Sing he used to sling on the th floor Check it

I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome fourfifth So I dip
NiXga is you creepin or speakin
He tells me CRock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door pitiful Is he in critical
Retaliation for this one wont be minimal
Cause Im a criminal
Way before the rap shit Bust the gat shit
Puff wont even know what happened
If its done smoothly
Silencers on the Uzi Stash in the hooptie
My alibi any cutie
With a booty that dont fucked Big Pop
Head spinnin reminiscin bout my man CRock Somebody gotta die

Honeys wanna chat but all we wanna know is where the party at
And I can bring ma GAT if not I hope i dont get shot
Better throw my vest on ma chest cause nias is a mess
It dont take nothin but frontin for me to start something

Thought they was creepin two trips to VA every third weekend
While you was sleepin he hit you on the box
Sixtynine code nonstop
Shoulda left ya then but my heart said not
You knew too much the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger huh go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next niXga
Asked my man Jigga my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off fore the shit balloon

Scalin fishes my love is concrete
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat
Of the Nautica Jeep weve been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on
Teary eyed damn a bitch steamin
Girls steady screamin Kim you need to leave him
When I testified in court couldnt think straight
Thinkin bout the bitches I fought
Over you you can have the shit you bought

So I had to plan my escape out the skins
In this world the fly girls Tanqueray and Hennesey
Until I call Earl months in this gut what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I can get buck wild
Juvenile with the mics n shit New York New York ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date May st was when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rolled herself
To the hospital to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck
Im seein my death and I aint even took my first step
I made it out im bringin mad joy
The doctor looked and said hes gonna be Bad Boy I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines I knew that I was
Goin somewhere let me take you back in time
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin somewhere Would Pac be alive if you let Pac drive
Swear to God to reverse it I give my left eye
With the right I visualized the king of BedStuy
Checkin his daughter Tianna into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and BI Was still alive in it might sound like this
N where Sues rendevouz
Its like Moulin Rouge
High fashion up town Air Force Ones
And Vasquez Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Lace Dutch masters we dump ashes on models and S Classes
For you bastards catch a cab to Manhattan
With that Broadway actin you hype that
belly shitd get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain ask Rog whats happennin
Out here nor speak no evil inside the Magnum I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines I knew that I was
Goin somewhere let me take you back in time Now Im smokin blunts makin green
Or on the drug scene fuck the football team
Risk it ruptured spleens by the age of
Hearin the coach scream make my lifetime dream
I mean I wanna blow up stack my doe up
So school I didnt show up and fuck my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf naww I couldnt see it
Scarface king of New York I wanna be it
Rap was secondary money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated kinda scary
C mark set me straight not able to move behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate damn were did I fail
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines I knew that I was
Goin somewhere let me take you back in time
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin somewhere Push

Unnecessary roughness career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid shoot em with a dart like Cupid
